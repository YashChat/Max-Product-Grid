# Max-Product-Grid
Given an N × N grid of integers and an integer M ≤ N , determine the maximum product that can be made from M integers that are next to each other in the grid (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.)

Consider the grid below.

   0 1 2 3 4
 0 4 5 8 1 9
 1 7 8 9 7 0
 2 0 1 2 8 4
 3 7 2 9 1 5
 4 3 9 3 5 8
 
The grid is of size 5 × 5 . If we consider any set of 3 integers in the grid (horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally), we find that the set with the highest product is {9, 9, 8} with a
product of 9 × 9 × 8 = 648.

In this part of the project, you must implement a solution to the following problem.

Given an N × N grid of integers and an integer M ≤ N , determine the maximum
product that can be made from M integers that are next to each other in the grid
(horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.)
Some of the test grids will be quite large, so we need to think about the performance of
the algorithm.
